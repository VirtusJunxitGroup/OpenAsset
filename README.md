# OpenAsset
OpenAsset is a public, open-source, GPL-3 licensed software for enabling the buying, selling and profiting of fraction(s) ("Token(s)", "NFT(s)") of ballested assets (e.g., off-plan properties, vehicles, etc) through blockchain.

### Context

Investing in off-plan properties can be reasonable profitable but many citizens doesn't have the opportunity to do it because it is expensive and requires a significant initial investment. Therefore it prevents many people from doing it.   
  
The purpose of this project is to combine technology, creativity and human understanding to democratize the access to asset investment while it supports financially the entities that truly holds these ballested assets.

### Recruiting

This is a huge open-source project with much possibilities in the future. I am looking for more developers, designers, devops engineers to actively contribute within the project and aggregate value to it. This project needs to make investment accessible to almost any player.

Current needings are:

- Product Owner
- Project Manager
- Node.js Backend Developer
- Next.js Frontend Developer
- AWS/DevOps Specialist

### Current Phase

The current phrase is to design an architecture for the Back-End services and APIs to provide writing, reading, listing, and intelligence of the transactions of assets. Any asset is actually generic, as you can negotiate anything that is ballasted.

### Generic Explanation of Usage

Let's suppose we have a building company called "House Building Example Company" and they are selling off-plan properties (each one is considered an asset). They publish their asset into the OpenAsset and therefore any player with at least US$1,000 can buy a fraction (token) of it, and in the future, when the building company sells the built property, anyone pursuing one or more fractions (tokens) of the asset will receive the respective (%) profit of it.  
  
Practical Example: Let's suppose there is a off-plan property (an asset) evaluated in US$100,000 and I buy ten tokens of US$1,000 each. Therefore, I 'own' 10% of the asset's future profit (when it is sold after built). Now let's suppose the asset was sold for the amount of US$200,000 (100% of profit from the initial off-plan value) after the building finished - now I receive a transference of US$10,000 (my initial investment of ten tokens) plus a profit of US$10,000 (10%) then I end up with US$20,000 in my bank account.

This is the future of descentralized investment for ballasted assets - it is horizontal, and not vertical; it is accessible to almost anyone.
